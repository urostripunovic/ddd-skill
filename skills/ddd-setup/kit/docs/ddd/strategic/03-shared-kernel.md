# Shared kernel

From Evans' Reference, "Shared Kernel":

> *Sharing a part of the model and associated code is a very intimate interdependency, which can leverage design work or undermine it.*
>
> When functional integration is limited, the overhead of continuous integration of a large context may be deemed too high. This may especially be true when the team does not have the skill or the political organization to maintain continuous integration, or when a single team is simply too big and unwieldy. So separate bounded contexts might be defined and multiple teams formed.
>
> Once separate, uncoordinated teams working on closely related applications can go racing forward for a while, but what they produce may not fit together. Even partner teams can end up spending a great deal on translation layers and retrofitting, meanwhile duplicating effort and losing the benefits of a common ubiquitous language.
>
> Therefore:
>
> **Designate with an explicit boundary some subset of the domain model that the teams agree to share. Keep this kernel small.**
>
> **Within this boundary, include, along with this subset of the model, the subset of code or of the database design associated with that part of the model. This explicitly shared stuff has special status, and shouldn't be changed without consultation with the other team.**
>
> Define a continuous integration process that will keep the kernel model tight and align the ubiquitous language of the teams. Integrate a functional system frequently, though somewhat less often than the pace of continuous integration within the teams.

## In this kit

This section is the kit's convention, not part of DDD.

One row in the Relationships table of `docs/domain/context-map.md`, with `shared kernel` as the Pattern. What crosses the boundary lists what is in the kernel. The kernel's terms appear in the glossary of each context that shares it.

## Corrections

<!-- Add a dated line each time this pattern turned out not to describe the relationship, and what it became. -->
